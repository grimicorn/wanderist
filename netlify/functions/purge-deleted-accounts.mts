/**
 * Scheduled Netlify Function: hard-deletes users whose soft-delete grace
 * period has elapsed (server/db/schema.ts users.deletedAt). See
 * server/utils/purgeAccounts.ts for the actual query — this file is a thin
 * adapter that wires that logic to a real DB connection and to Netlify's
 * scheduled-function invocation.
 *
 * Deliberately lives outside server/ and is bundled independently by
 * Netlify (not by Nitro): Nitro's netlify preset bundles server/api/**
 * into a single request-driven function, which has no facility for a
 * cron-scheduled invocation. netlify/functions/ is Netlify's own,
 * separate functions directory, wired to a schedule below via
 * netlify.toml ([functions."purge-deleted-accounts"].schedule).
 *
 * Because this file is not part of the Nitro bundle, it cannot use
 * useRuntimeConfig() or any other Nitro auto-import — it reads
 * DATABASE_URL directly from process.env via createDb().
 *
 * Security note: Netlify does not expose scheduled functions on a public,
 * directly-invokable HTTP endpoint — they can only be triggered by
 * Netlify's own scheduler (or a project member via the CLI/API), so no
 * additional secret/auth check is added here.
 *
 * Observability note: this file runs outside the Nitro bundle, so it does
 * not get the @sentry/nuxt server instrumentation configured in
 * sentry.server.config.ts. A failed run is logged and then re-thrown (see
 * below) so Netlify's scheduled-function run history records it as a
 * failed invocation, rather than silently returning 200/500 with nothing
 * to consume the status — but there is no active alert wired to that
 * failure yet. Wiring this function into Sentry directly (a separate
 * @sentry/node init, since it isn't bundled by Nitro) is worth doing before
 * this job is depended on for compliance-grade deletion SLAs, but is out of
 * scope for this change; flagged here rather than silently left out.
